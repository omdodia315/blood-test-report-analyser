Detailed Bug & Fix 

1. main.py

Bugs:

Direct execution of Crew.kickoff() inside API handler ‚Üí blocks FastAPI event loop.

Unused imports like asyncio and Form.

Business logic mixed with API routing.

Fixes:

Replaced with a background worker queue model using Dramatiq.

Removed unused imports.

API only triggers background task; logic moved to worker.py.

2. agents.py

Bugs:

llm = llm is invalid (undefined reference).

Outdated import path from crewai.agents import Agent.

Incorrect use of .read_data_tool.

Fixes:

Correctly imported and initialized ChatOpenAI.

Updated agent import to from crewai import Agent.

Passed the BloodTestReportTool() object directly.

3. task.py

Bugs:

Incorrect tool usage:

tools=[BloodTestReportTool.read_data_tool]  # invalid static reference

Fixes:

Correct tool injection:

tools=[BloodTestReportTool()]  # alid object usage

4. tools.py

Bugs:

Method read_data_tool was async unnecessarily.

Used undefined class PDFLoader.

Imported unused SerperDevTool.

Fixes:

Replaced with run() method using PyPDFLoader.

Removed all unused imports.

Rewrote tool as a proper synchronous class with a run() method, which matches crewai expectations.

5. requirements.txt

Bugs:

Potential dependency conflict due to strict version pinning:

numpy==1.26.4  #  could conflict with other libs

Fixes:

Commented out to allow other libraries to manage compatible versions:

#numpy==1.26.4  #  safe removal

üì¶ Bonus Fix: worker.py (New File)

Upgraded to Queue Woker Model to handle concurrent requests with help of REDIS AND DRAMATIQ

Supports better API responsiveness and scalability.

üìå Notes

Redis must be running on localhost:6379

Dramatiq worker must be started in parallel with the FastAPI server

Handles invalid PDFs and displays basic fallback messages


‚ö†Ô∏è Database Integration (Attempted but Not Included)
This project originally included an attempt to integrate persistent data storage using SQLite and SQLAlchemy. The goal was to store analysis results permanently instead of caching them in Redis.

However, due to:

üß© Complex module import issues (especially on Windows)

üîÅ Path conflicts when running with uvicorn and Dramatiq
